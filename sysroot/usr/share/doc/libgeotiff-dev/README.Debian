libgeotiff for Debian
---------------------

** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT **

This version of the GeoTIFF library lacks the EPSG data files which are distributed
in a separate non-free package libgeotiff-epsg due to license limitations. 
The library is anyway working and usable also without those files. If you need 
to have reference information for standard projections, you have to install 
that additional package.
